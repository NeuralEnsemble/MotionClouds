## BEFORE STARTING THE INSTALLATION ##

* If you have not installed pip:
 -> http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html

* If you don't use bash, check the 'export PATH' line 15, 16 & 17
 -> for exemple, with zsh:
15 echo "export PATH=/[...]PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
16 echo "export PYTHONPATH=/[...]PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
17 echo "export QT_API=pyqt" >> ~/.zshrc

* If you have any to install, it will last about 42 minutes
(installing vtk and mayavi is very slow)

                              (
                               )
be patient and take a coffee c[]

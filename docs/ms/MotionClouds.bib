    abstract = {Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

Here, we describe a framework to generate random texture movies with controlled information content, i.e., Motion Clouds. These stimuli are defined using a generative model that is based on controlled experimental parametrization. We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown.

    abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. {W.H}. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

This method is based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals and does not use voltage-sensitive dyes. Images of the living monkey striate ({VI}) and extrastriate (V2) visual cortex, taken during visual stimulation, were analyzed to yield maps of the distribution of cells with various functional properties. The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe. The orientation tuning of other regions of V2 appeared organized as modules that are larger and more uniform than those in V1.},

    abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly classified as simple or complex based upon their sensitivity to the sign of stimulus contrast. The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

@article{Neri98,
    abstract = {One of the more stunning examples of the resourcefulness of human vision is the ability to see 'biological motion', which was first shown with an adaptation of earlier cinematic work: illumination of only the joints of a walking person is enough to convey a vivid, compelling impression of human animation, although the percept collapses to a jumble of meaningless lights when the walker stands still. The information is sufficient to discriminate the sex and other details of the walker, and can be interpreted by young infants. Here we measure the ability of the visual system to integrate this type of motion information over space and time, and compare this capacity with that for viewing simple translational motion. Sensitivity to biological motion increases rapidly with the number of illuminated joints, far more rapidly than for simple motion. Furthermore, this information is summed over extended temporal intervals of up to 3 seconds (eight times longer than for simple motion). The steepness of the summation curves indicates that the mechanisms that analyse biological motion do not integrate linearly over space and time with constant efficiency, as may occur for other forms of complex motion, but instead adapt to the nature of the stimulus.},

@article{Jasinschi92,
    abstract = {Perceptual motion transparency occurs whenever two or more patterns are seen moving at different depth levels, such that we can see one pattern move across the others, and perceptual motion coherence occurs when we see a single motion. We present here a model of perceptual motion transparency and coherence that consists of three stages: (i) measure the normal velocity along contours or the velocity of features such as corners or line end points; (ii) take the intersection, in velocity space, of all possible pairs of constraint lines associated with the normal velocity components; and (iii) combine the results of steps (i) and (ii) in the velocity histogram, which is the plot of the total number of votes for each velocity in velocity space. For two patterns we perceive motion coherence, transparency, or a mixture of both types of motion depending on whether the velocity histogram is unimodal, bimodal, or trimodal. According to our model we perceive motion transparency or coherence depending on the total number of prominent peaks of the velocity histogram, where each peak is located at the position corresponding to the velocity of one of the patterns or of coherent motion. We show that the number of prominent peaks in the velocity histogram depends on the error in the measurement of the local velocity and on the relative orientation of the local velocities along contours; this relative orientation encodes contour shape. Our model differs from current motion theories in that it describes the perception of motion not as a result of local velocity extraction but instead as the result of the integration of local velocity and geometrical shape information across different points of the image and across superimposed patterns. This model allows for the occurrence of mixed motion perception, which arises from the combination of the velocity information associated with motion transparency and coherence. We have tested this model through computational and psychophysical experiments done with line patterns. As a result of these experiments we conjecture that the human visual system may use at least three stages to process image velocity.},

@article{Nishimoto11,
    abstract = {Area {MT} has been an important target for studies of motion processing. However, previous neurophysiological studies of {MT} have used simple stimuli that do not contain many of the motion signals that occur during natural vision. In this study we sought to determine whether views of area {MT} neurons developed using simple stimuli can account for {MT} responses under more naturalistic conditions. We recorded responses from macaque area {MT} neurons during stimulation with naturalistic movies. We then used a quantitative modeling framework to discover which specific mechanisms best predict neuronal responses under these challenging conditions. We find that the simplest model that accurately predicts responses of {MT} neurons consists of a bank of V1-like filters, each followed by a compressive nonlinearity, a divisive nonlinearity, and linear pooling. Inspection of the fit models shows that the excitatory receptive fields of {MT} neurons tend to lie on a single plane within the three-dimensional spatiotemporal frequency domain, and suppressive receptive fields lie off this plane. However, most excitatory receptive fields form a partial ring in the plane and avoid low temporal frequencies. This receptive field organization ensures that most {MT} neurons are tuned for velocity but do not tend to respond to ambiguous static textures that are aligned with the direction of motion. In sum, {MT} responses to naturalistic movies are largely consistent with predictions based on simple stimuli. However, models fit using naturalistic stimuli reveal several novel properties of {MT} receptive fields that had not been shown in prior experiments.},

@article{Geisler09,
    abstract = {The environments in which an organism lives and the tasks it performs within those environments shape its perceptual systems through evolution and experience. This is an obvious statement, but it implies several fundamental components of research that are needed if we are going to gain a deep understanding of perceptual systems. The first is to identify the natural tasks and sub-tasks that are performed by the organism under natural conditions. The second is to measure and analyze those specific environmental properties (natural scene statistics) relevant for performing the tasks. The third is a computational analysis to determine how a rational (ideal) perceptual system would exploit the measured environmental properties to perform the tasks. This component is critical because it provides insight into the information contained in the natural stimuli and it can suggest principled hypotheses for the neural mechanisms the organism might use to exploit that information. The fourth component is to formulate specific hypotheses for neural mechanisms, based on the first three components, and test them in physiological and behavioral studies that capture the essence of the natural task. This general approach is illustrated with a study of contour grouping that combines measurements of natural scene statistics, derivation of ideal Bayesian observers that exploit those statistics, and psychophysical experiments that compare human and ideal performance. This study and other recent studies demonstrate the great potential of ``natural systems analysis'' for producing advances in behavioral science and systems neuroscience.},

In addition, many are selective for the motion of complex patterns independent of the orientation of their components, a behavior not seen in earlier visual areas. We show that the responses of {MT} cells can be captured by a linear-nonlinear model that operates not on the visual stimulus, but on the afferent responses of a population of nonlinear V1 cells. We fit this cascade model to responses of individual {MT} neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in {MT}. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

@article{Braddick93,
    abstract = {Reliable motion perception requires processes that integrate visual motion signals from neighbouring locations in the visual field, which should have the effect of smoothing out spatial variations in velocity. However, we also require motion processing to be very sensitive to local velocity differences, so that moving objects appear sharply distinct from their background and specific differential properties of optic flow associated with the observer's motion can be detected. Perceptual experiments give evidence both for integrative processes, which lead to spreading of perceived motion, and for differential processes, which lead to motion contrast and segmentation. Current and future experiments might allow tests of theoretical schemes that employ adaptive networks and/or multiple representations in order to reconcile the conflicting demands of integration and segmentation.},

    abstract = {An ultimate goal of systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory stimuli encountered in the natural environment are processed by neural circuits. Achieving this goal requires knowledge of both the characteristics of natural stimuli and the response properties of sensory neurons under natural stimulation. Most of our current notions of sensory processing have come from experiments using simple, parametric stimulus sets. However, a growing number of researchers have begun to question whether this approach alone is sufficient for understanding the real-life sensory tasks performed by the organism. Here, focusing on the early visual pathway, we argue that the use of natural stimuli is vital for advancing our understanding of sensory processing.},

@article{Field99,
    abstract = {The processing of spatial information by the visual system shows a number of similarities to the wavelet transforms that have become popular in applied mathematics. Over the last decade, a range of studies have focused on the question of 'why' the visual system would evolve this strategy of coding spatial information. One such approach has focused on the relationship between the visual code and the statistics of natural scenes under the assumption that the visual system has evolved this strategy as a means of optimizing the representation of its visual environment. This paper reviews some of this literature and looks at some of the statistical properties of natural scenes that allow this code to be efficient. It is argued that such wavelet codes are efficient because they increase the independence of the vectors' outputs (i.e. they increase the independence of the responses of the visual neurons) by finding the sparse structure available in the input. Studies with neural networks that attempt to maximize the 'sparsity' of the representation have been shown to produce vectors (neural receptive fields) that have many of the properties of a wavelet representation. It is argued that the visual environment has the appropriate sparse structure to make this sparse output possible. It is argued that these sparse/independent representations make it computationally easier to detect and represent the higher--order structure present in complex environmental data.},

@article{Henriksson08,
    abstract = {Human medial occipital cortex comprises multiple visual areas, each with a distinct retinotopic representation of visual environment. We measured spatial frequency ({SF}) tuning curves with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and found consistent differences between these areas. Areas V1, V2, {VP}, V3, V4v, and {V3A} were all band-pass tuned, with progressively lower {SF} optima in V1, V2, and {V3A}. In {VP} and V3, the {SF} optima were similar to optima in V2, whereas V4v showed more individual variation and scattered {SF} representations on the cortical surface. Area V5+ showed low-pass {SF} tuning. In each area, the {SF} optimum declined with increasing eccentricity. After accounting for the cortical magnification, the cortical extent of the optimal spatial wavelengths was approximately constant across eccentricity in V1, which suggests an anatomical constraint for the optimal {SF}, and this extent is actually comparable to the extent of horizontal connections within primate V1. The optimal spatial wavelengths in the visual field are also of similar extent to the spatial summation fields of macaque V1. The progressive decline in the {SF} tuning from V1 to V2 and {V3A} is compatible with the view that these areas represent visual information at different spatial scales.},

@article{Singh00,
    abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) we have studied the variation in response magnitude, in each visual area ({V1-V5}), as a function of spatial frequency ({SF}), temporal frequency ({TF}) and unidirectional motion versus counterphase flicker. Each visual area was identified in each subject using a combination of retinotopic mapping {fMRI} and cortical flattening techniques. A drifting (or counterphasing) sinusoidal grating was used as the stimulus in a study in which we parametrically varied {SF} between 0.4 and 7 cycles/degree and {TF} between 0 and 18 Hz. For each experiment we constructed {fMRI} amplitude tuning curves, averaged across subjects, for each visual area. The tuning curves that resulted are consistent with the known physiological properties of cells in the corresponding macaque visual areas, previous functional imaging studies, and in the case of V1, the psychophysically determined contrast sensitivity functions for spatial and temporal frequency. In the case of {V3A}, the {SF} tuning functions obtained were more similar to those found in single cell studies of macaque V3 rather than macaque {V3A}. All areas showed at least a moderate preference for directed versus counterphasing motion with V5 showing the largest preference. Visual areas V1, V2, V3, and {V3A} showed more direction sensitivity at low spatial frequencies, while {VP}, V4, and V5 had the highest drifting versus counterphasing ratios for higher spatial frequencies.},

@article{Shmuel96,
    abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the functional organization of direction of motion in cat area 18. Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.},

We found that (i) the optical responses to all orientations and spatial frequencies were well approximated by weighted sums of only two pairs of basis pictures, one pair for orientation and a different pair for spatial frequency; (ii) the weightings of the two pictures in each pair were approximately in quadrature (1/4 cycle apart); and (iii) our spatial frequency data revealed a cortical map that continuously assigns different optimal spatial frequency responses to different cortical locations over the entire spatial frequency range.},

The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

@article{Drewes08,
    abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the visual system is optimized to process naturalistic inputs for both low and high level processing. Here we search for an advantageous effect of natural scene statistics when estimating speed. Ocular following responses ({OFRs}) are reflexive eye movements known to reflect many properties of low-level motion processing. Using the scleral search coil technique, we recorded human {OFRs} to drifting sinusoidal gratings ({1D}) as well as narrow bandpass noise images ({2D}).For sinusoidal gratings, it was previously shown that {OFRs} are best elicited with low spatial frequency stimuli ([[lt]]1cpd) moving at optimal speed (20--40\\\\$\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\$/s). We were able to confirm this for {2D} noise stimuli as well. However, we found a systematic difference in the acceleration profiles: {OFRs} to {2D} noise stimuli consistently showed longer latencies, yet stronger overall responses than the {1D} gratings. When combining two or more spatial frequencies, we found a gain in response strength mostly in the higher spatial frequency range. Also, we found evidence that stimuli consisting of the normalized sum of several spatial frequencies can create stronger {OFRs} than the normalized sum of the {OFRs} to the individual frequencies. When combining spatial frequencies, the weighting (mix ratio) of the individual frequencies influences the response gain. The optimum weighting with multiple bandpass noises appeared to be similar to the spectral shape of natural scenes ({1/f).These} results show a systematic difference between {OFRs} evoked by {1D} gratings and {2D} noises, and provide a first behavioral evidence that speed is best estimated by combining information across different channels, with weighting based on natural scene statistics.},

@article{Klein00,
    abstract = {The spectrotemporal receptive field ({STRF}) is a functional descriptor of the linear processing of time-varying acoustic spectra by the auditory system. By cross-correlating sustained neuronal activity with the dynamic spectrum of a spectrotemporally rich stimulus ensemble, one obtains an estimate of the {STRF}. In this article, the relationship between the spectrotemporal structure of any given stimulus and the quality of the {STRF} estimate is explored and exploited. Invoking the Fourier theorem, arbitrary dynamic spectra are described as sums of basic sinusoidal components---that is, moving ripples. Accurate estimation is found to be especially reliant on the prominence of components whose spectral and temporal characteristics are of relevance to the auditory locus under study and is sensitive to the phase relationships between components with identical temporal signatures. These and other observations have guided the development and use of stimuli with deterministic dynamic spectra composed of the superposition of many temporally orthogonal moving ripples having a restricted, relevant range of spectral scales and temporal rates. The method, termed sum-of-ripples, is similar in spirit to the white-noise approach butenjoys the same practical advantages---which equate to faster and moreaccurate estimation---attributable to the time-domain sum-of-sinusoidsmethod previously employed in vision research. Application of the methodis exemplified with both modeled data and experimental data from ferretprimary auditory cortex ({AI}).},

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals.

@article{Daugman80,
    abstract = {Most vision research embracing the spatial frequency paradigm has been conceptually and mathematically a one-dimensional analysis of two-dimensional mechanisms. Spatial vision models and the experiments sustaining them have generally treated spatial frequency as a one-dimensional variable, even though receptive fields and retinal images are two-dimensional and linear transform theory obliges any frequency analysis to preserve dimension. Four models of cortical receptive fields are introduced and studied here in {2D} form, in order to illustrate the relationship between their excitatory/inhibitory spatial structure and their resulting {2D} spectral properties. It emerges that only a very special analytic class of receptive fields possess independent tuning functions for spatial frequency and orientation; namely, those profiles whose two-dimensional Fourier Transforms are expressible as the separable product of a radial function and an angular function. Furthermore, only such receptive fields would have the same orientation tuning curve for single bars as for gratings. All classes lacking this property would describe cells responsive to different orientations for different spatial frequencies and vice versa; this is shown to be the case, for example, for the Hubel \& Wiesel model of cortical orientation-tuned simple cells receiving inputs from an aligned row of center/surround {LGN} cells. When these results are considered in conjunction with psychophysical evidence for nonseparability of spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties within a '' channel'', it becomes mandatory that future spatial vision research of the Fourier genre take on an explicitly two-dimensional character.},

@article{Jones87,
    abstract = {1. Using the two-dimensional ({2D}) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as {2D} Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found {2D} Gabor filters that fit the {2D} spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the {2D} spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent {2D} spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the {2D} Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the {2D} spatial and spatial frequency domains.},

In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex.},

This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

    abstract = {Lu and Sperling [Vision Res. 35, 2697 (1995)] proposed that human visual motion perception is served by three separate motion systems: a first-order system that responds to moving luminance patterns, a second-order system that responds to moving modulations of feature types-stimuli in which the expected luminance is the same everywhere but an area of higher contrast or of flicker moves, and a third-order system that computes the motion of marked locations in a "salience map," that is, a neural representation of visual space in which the locations of important visual features ("figure") are marked and "ground" is unmarked. Subsequently, there have been some strongly confirmatory reports: different gain-control mechanisms for first- and second-order motion, selective impairment of first- versus second- and/or third-order motion by different brain injuries, and the classification of new third-order motions, e.g., isoluminant chromatic motion. Various procedures have successfully discriminated between second- and third-order motion (when first-order motion is excluded): dual tasks, second-order reversed phi, motion competition, and selective adaptation. Meanwhile, eight apparent contradictions to the three-systems theory have been proposed. A review and reanalysis here of the new evidence, pro and con, resolves the challenges and yields a more clearly defined and significantly strengthened theory.},

@article{Rust05,
    abstract = {The visual system evolved to process natural images, and the goal of visual neuroscience is to understand the computations it uses to do this. Indeed the goal of any theory of visual function is a model that will predict responses to any stimulus, including natural scenes. It has, however, recently become common to take this fundamental principle one step further: trying to use photographic or cinematographic representations of natural scenes (natural stimuli) as primary probes to explore visual computations. This approach is both challenging and controversial, and we argue that this use of natural images is so fraught with difficulty that it is not useful. Traditional methods for exploring visual computations that use artificial stimuli with carefully selected properties have been and continue to be the most effective tools for visual neuroscience. The proper use of natural stimuli is to test models based on responses to these synthetic stimuli, not to replace them.},

    abstract = {Rats discriminate objects by scanning their surface with the facial vibrissae, producing spatiotemporally complex sequences of tactile contacts. The way in which the somatosensory cortex responds to these complex multivibrissal stimuli has not been explored. It is unclear yet whether contextual information from across the entire whisker pad influences cortical responses. Here, we delivered tactile stimuli to the rat vibrissae using a new 24 whisker stimulator. We tested sequences of rostrocaudal whisker deflections that generate multivibrissal motion patterns in different directions across the mystacial pad, allowing to disambiguate local from global sensory integration. Unitary electrophysiological recordings from different layers of the barrel cortex showed that a majority of neurons has direction selectivity for the multivibrissal stimulus. The selectivity resulted from nonlinear integration of responses across the mystacial pad. Our results indicate that the system extracts collective properties of a tactile scene.},

@article{Fischer07cv,
    abstract = {{M}eanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popular image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. {T}hese transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. {A}t the same time their optimization get a challenging task. {W}e proposed here a log-{G}abor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the {G}abor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. {T}wo major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. {A}nd second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). {T}he transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the {P}rimary {V}isual {C}ortex ({V}1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. {C}ompared to the state of the art, the log-{G}abor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent {G}aussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. {S}uch characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

    abstract = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensori-motor transformation, such as in ocular following response ({OFR}), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss, Y., Simoncelli, {E.P}., Adelson, {E.H}., 2002. Motion illusions as optimal percepts. Nature Neuroscience, 5(6), 598-604, doi:10.1038/nn858] which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the {OFR} for different levels of noise with full field gratings. More recent experiments of {OFR} have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barth\'{e}lemy, {F.V}., Vanzetta, I., Masson, {G.S}., 2006. Behavioral receptive field for ocular following in humans: dynamics of spatial summation and center-surround interactions. Journal of Neurophysiology, (95), 3712-3726, doi:10.1152/jn.00112.2006]. Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can describe the spatial integration of the motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

@article{Barthelemy08a,
    abstract = {Integrating information is essential to measure the physical {2D} motion of a surface from both ambiguous local {1D} motion of its elongated edges and non-ambiguous {2D} motion of its features such as corners or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local {1D} motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then {2D} motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these {1D} and {2D} motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, {1D}-driven and late, {2D}-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of {1D}-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late {2D}-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both {1D}- and {2D}-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of {1D} and {2D} motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between {1D}- and {2D}-motion supports the fact that {1D} and {2D} probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that {1D} and {2D} mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.},

    abstract = {
                Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.

@article{Knierim92,
    abstract = {1. We recorded responses from neurons in area V1 of the alert macaque monkey to textured patterns modeled after stimuli used in psychophysical experiments of pop-out. Neuronal responses to a single oriented line segment placed within a cell's classical receptive field ({CRF}) were compared with responses in which the center element was surrounded by rings of elements placed entirely outside the {CRF}. The orientations of the surround elements either matched the center element, were orthogonal to it, or were random. 2. The addition of the textured surround tended to suppress the response to the center element by an average of 34\%. Overall, almost 80\% of the 122 cells analyzed in detail were significantly suppressed by at least one of the texture surrounds. 3. Cells tended to respond more strongly to a stimulus in which there was a contrast in orientation between the center and surround than to a stimulus lacking such contrast. The average difference was 9\% of the response to the optimally oriented center element alone. For the 32\% of the cells showing a statistically significant orientation contrast effect, the average difference was 28\%. 4. Both the general suppression and orientation contrast effects originated from surround regions at the ends of the center bar as well as regions along the sides of the center bar. 5. The amount of suppression induced by the texture surround decreased as the density of the texture elements decreased. 6. Both the general suppression and the orientation contrast effects appeared early in the population response to the stimuli. The general suppression effect took approximately 7 ms to develop, whereas the orientation contrast effect took 18-20 ms to develop. 7. These results are consistent with a possible functional role of V1 cells in the mediation of perceptual pop-out and in the segregation of texture borders. Possible anatomic substrates of the effects are discussed.},

    abstract = {A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a ?compact? coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal {RMS} error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal ?compact? code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of ?sparse distributed? coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling ?wavelet transforms? are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image.

    abstract = {The problem of digital painting is considered from a signal processing viewpoint, and is reconsidered as a problem of directed texture synthesis. It is an important characteristic of natural texture that detail may be evident at many scales, and the detail at each scale may have distinct characteristics. A '' sparse convolution'' procedure for generating random textures with arbitrary spectral content is described. The capability of specifying the texture spectrum (and thus the amount of detail at each scale) is an improvement over stochastic texture synthesis processes which are scalebound or which have a prescribed 1/f spectrum. This spectral texture synthesis procedure provides the basis for a digital paint system which rivals the textural sophistication of traditional artistic media. Applications in terrain synthesis and texturing computer-rendered objects are also shown.},

@article{Essock09,
    abstract = {Broadband oriented-noise masks were used to assess the orientation properties of spatial-context suppression in 'general' viewing conditions (i.e., a fixated, large field of 'naturalistic' noise). Suppression was orientation-tuned with a Gaussian shape and bandwidth of 40\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$ that was consistent across test orientation (0\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, 45\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, 90\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, and 135\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$). Strength of suppression was highly anisotropic following a '' horizontal effect'' pattern (strongest suppression at horizontal and least suppression at oblique test orientations). Next, the time course of anisotropic masking was investigated by varying stimulus onset asynchrony ({SOA}). A standard '' oblique effect'' anisotropy is observed at long {SOAs} but becomes a '' horizontal effect'' when a noise mask is present within approximately 50 ms of the test onset. The orientation-tuned masking appears to result from an anisotropic gain-control mechanism that pools the weighted responses to the broadband mask, resulting in a changeover from oblique effect to horizontal effect. In addition, the relative magnitude of suppression at the orientations tested corresponds to the relative magnitudes of the content of typical natural scenes at the same orientations. We suggest that this anisotropic suppression may serve to equalize the visual system's response across orientation when viewing typical natural scenes, 'discounting' the anisotropy of typical natural scene content.},

Contrast thresholds for the detection of gratings whose luminance profiles are sine, square, rectangular or saw-tooth waves can be simply related using Fourier theory.3. Over a wide range of spatial frequencies the contrast threshold of a grating is determined only by the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier component of its wave form.4. Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sine-wave gratings until their contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their independent threshold.5. These findings can be explained by the existence within the nervous system of linearly operating independent mechanisms selectively sensitive to limited ranges of spatial frequencies.},

We use dynamic displays composed of discrete spatiotemporal wavelets, comparing three conditions ("single," "parallel," and "random"). In contrast to static displays, we do not find that attention modulates the "dipper" regime for masks of low luminance contrast. Nor does attention alter direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in random directions, a condition designed to isolate effects on component motion. However, direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in parallel is significantly reduced by attention. As the latter condition is expected to excite both component and pattern motion mechanisms, this implies that attention may alter the visual representation of pattern motion. In addition, attention exhibits its well-known effect of reducing lateral masking between nearby spatiotemporal wavelets.},

@article{Chen05,
    abstract = {Visual motion is sensed by low-level (energy-based) and high-level (feature-based) mechanisms. Our interest is in the motion detectors underlying the initial ocular following responses ({OFR}) that are elicited at ultrashort latencies by sudden motions of large images. {OFR} were elicited in humans by applying horizontal motion to vertical square-wave gratings lacking the fundamental. In the frequency domain, a pure square wave is composed of the odd harmonics--first, third, fifth, seventh, etc.--such that the third, fifth, seventh, etc., have amplitudes that are one-third, one-fifth, one-seventh, etc., that of the first, and the missing fundamental stimulus lacks the first harmonic. Motion consisted of successive quarter-wavelength steps, so the features and 4n+1 harmonics (where n = integer) shifted forward, whereas the 4n-1 harmonics--including the strongest Fourier component (the third harmonic)--shifted backward (spatial aliasing). Thus, the net Fourier energy and the {non-Fourier} features moved in opposite directions. Initial {OFR}, recorded with the search coil technique, had minimum latencies of 60 to 70 ms and were always in the direction of the third harmonic, for example, leftward steps resulted in rightward {OFR}. Thus, the earliest {OFR} were strongly dependent on the motion of the major Fourier component, consistent with mediation by oriented spatiotemporal visual filters as in the well-known energy model of motion detection. Introducing interstimulus intervals of 10 to 100 ms (during which the screen was uniform gray) reversed the initial direction of tracking, consistent with extensive neurophysiological and psychophysical data suggesting that the visual input to the motion detectors has a biphasic temporal impulse response.},

@article{Del-Viva98,
    abstract = {We have developed a two-stage model of motion perception that identifies moving spatial features and computes their velocity, achieving both high spatial localisation and reliable estimates of velocity. Features are detected in each frame by locating the peaks of the spatial local energy functions, as for stationary images (Morrone {MC} and Burr {DC}. Proc R Soc Lond {1988;B235}:221-245.). The energy functions are calculated for different scales and orientations, and integrated within a temporal Gaussian window. The velocity of features is determined by the direction of maximal elongation of the energy in space-time, evaluated by calculating the three characteristic curvatures of the energy at each feature point. To circumvent the aperture problem, the energy maps are blurred in space by various amounts, and velocity is computed separately for each spatial blur. The Weber fraction of the local curvatures (curvature contrast) describes the spatio-temporal energy elongation at each feature point, giving a reliability index for each velocity estimate. For each point, the velocity of the spatial blur that yielded the highest curvature contrast was selected, with no further constraints, such as rigidity of motion. Dynamic recruitment of operators of different size allows maximum flexibility of the analysis, allowing it to simulate human visual performance in the detection of noise images, transparent motion, some motion illusions, and second-order motion.},

    abstract = {The visual responses of neurons in the cerebral cortex were first adequately characterized in the 1960s by D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel [(1962) J. Physiol. (London) 160, 106-154; (1968) J. Physiol. (London) 195, 215-243] using qualitative analyses based on simple geometric visual targets. Over the past 30 years, it has become common to consider the properties of these neurons by attempting to make formal descriptions of these transformations they execute on the visual image. Most such models have their roots in linear-systems approaches pioneered in the retina by C. {Enroth-Cugell} and J. R. Robson [(1966) J. Physiol. (London) 187, 517-552], but it is clear that purely linear models of cortical neurons are inadequate. We present two related models: one designed to account for the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) and one designed to account for the responses of pattern direction selective cells in {MT} (or V5), an extrastriate visual area thought to be involved in the analysis of visual motion. These models share a common structure that operates in the same way on different kinds of input, and instantiate the widely held view that computational strategies are similar throughout the cerebral cortex. Implementations of these models for Macintosh microcomputers are available and can be used to explore the models' properties.},

@article{Thomson00,
    abstract = {Fourier-phase information is important in determining the appearance of natural scenes, but the structure of natural-image phase spectra is highly complex and difficult to relate directly to human perceptual processes. This problem is addressed by extending previous investigations of human visual sensitivity to the randomisation and quantisation of Fourier phase in natural images. The salience of the image changes induced by these physical processes is shown to depend critically on the nature of the original phase spectrum of each image, and the processes of randomisation and quantisation are shown to be perceptually equivalent provided that they shift image phase components by the same average amount. These results are explained by assuming that the visual system is sensitive to those phase-domain image changes which also alter certain global higher-order image statistics. This assumption may be used to place constraints on the likely nature of cortical processing: mechanisms which correlate the outputs of a bank of relative-phase-sensitive units are found to be consistent with the patterns of sensitivity reported here.},

@article{Rieke95,
    abstract = {Natural sounds, especially communication sounds, have highly structured amplitude and phase spectra. We have quantified how structure in the amplitude spectrum of natural sounds affects coding in primary auditory afferents. Auditory afferents encode stimuli with naturalistic amplitude spectra dramatically better than broad-band stimuli (approximating white noise); the rate at which the spike train carries information about the stimulus is 2-6 times higher for naturalistic sounds. Furthermore, the information rates can reach 90\% of the fundamental limit to information transmission set by the statistics of the spike response. These results indicate that the coding strategy of the auditory nerve is matched to the structure of natural sounds; this `tuning' allows afferent spike trains to provide higher processing centres with a more complete description of the sensory world.},

    abstract = {
                Short-latency ocular following are reflexive, tracking eye movements that are observed in human and non-human primates in response to a sudden and brief translation of the image. Initial, open-loop part of the eye acceleration reflects many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing. We review a very large set of behavioral data demonstrating several key properties of motion detection and integration stages and their dynamics. We propose that these properties can be modeled as a behavioral receptive field exhibiting linear and nonlinear mechanisms responsible for context-dependent spatial integration and gain control. Functional models similar to that used for describing neuronal properties of receptive fields can then be applied successfully.

    abstract = {How are local motion signals integrated to form a global motion percept? We investigate the neural mechanisms of tactile motion integration by presenting tactile gratings and plaids to the fingertips of monkeys, using the tactile analogue of a visual monitor and recording the responses evoked in somatosensory cortical neurons. The perceived directions of the gratings and plaids are measured in parallel psychophysical experiments. We identify a population of somatosensory neurons that exhibit integration properties comparable to those induced by analogous visual stimuli in area {MT} and find that these neural responses account for the perceived direction of the stimuli across all stimulus conditions tested. The preferred direction of the neurons and the perceived direction of the stimuli can be predicted from the weighted average of the directions of the individual stimulus features, highlighting that the somatosensory system implements a vector average mechanism to compute tactile motion direction that bears striking similarities to its visual counterpart.},

@article{Perrinet10shl,
    abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism which optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair: By contributing to optimize statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

There is no reason to suppose that the visual system contains motion sensors dedicated to the analysis of second-order motion. Current psychophysical and physiological data indicate that local motion sensors are selective for orientation and spatial frequency but they do not eliminate any of the three main models---the Reichardt detector, the motion-energy filter, and gradient-based sensors. Both psychophysical and physiological data suggest that both broadly oriented and narrowly oriented motion sensors are important in the early analysis of motion in two dimensions.},

We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.},

@article{Wang11,
    abstract = {Motion-in-depth causes changes in the size of retinal images in addition to producing optic flow patterns. A previous psychophysical study showed that human subjects can perceive expansion motion in texture stimuli that exhibit increases in the scale of image elements but no consistent optic flow pattern. The neural mechanisms by which the scale-change information is processed remain unknown. Here, we measured the responses of cat V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) neurons to a sequence of random images whose spatial frequency spectrum changed over time (i.e., average spatial scale expanded or contracted). We found that V1 neurons exhibit direction sensitivity to scale changes, with more cells preferring expansion than contraction motion. This direction sensitivity can be partly accounted for by the spectrotemporal receptive field of V1 neurons. Comparison of the direction sensitivity between V1 and {LGN} neurons showed that the sensitivity in V1 may originate from {LGN} neurons. Repetitive stimulation with expansion or contraction motion can decrease the sensitivity to the adapted direction in V1, and the effect can be transferred interocularly, suggesting that intracortical connections may be critically involved in the adaptation. Together, our results suggest that direction sensitivity to scale change in V1 may contribute to motion-in-depth processing.},

@article{Schrater00,
    abstract = {Visual motion is processed by neurons in primary visual cortex that are sensitive to spatial orientation and speed. Many models of local velocity computation are based on a second stage that pools the outputs of first-stage neurons selective for different orientations, but the nature of this pooling remains controversial. In a human psychophysical detection experiment, we found near-perfect summation of image energy when it was distributed uniformly across all orientations, but poor summation when it was concentrated in specific orientation bands. The data are consistent with a model that integrates uniformly over all orientations, even when this strategy is sub-optimal.},

@article{Scarfe10,
    abstract = {The perceived position of stationary objects can appear shifted in space due to the presence of motion in another part of the visual field (motion drag). We investigated this phenomenon with global motion Gabor arrays. These arrays consist of randomly oriented Gabors (Gaussian windowed sinusoidal luminance modulations) whose speed is set such that the normal component of the individual Gabor's motion is consistent with a single {2D} global velocity. Global motion arrays were shown to alter the perceived position of nearby stationary objects. The size of this shift was the same as that induced by arrays of Gabors uniformly oriented in the direction of global motion and drifting at the global motion speed. Both types of array were found to be robust to large changes in array density and exhibited the same time course of effect. The motion drag induced by the global motion arrays was consistent with the estimated {2D} global velocity, rather than by the component of the local velocities in the global motion direction. This suggests that the motion signal that induces motion drag originates at or after a stage at which local motion signals have been integrated to produce a global motion estimate.},

@article{Bradley08,
    abstract = {Computational neuroscience combines theory and experiment to shed light on the principles and mechanisms of neural computation. This approach has been highly fruitful in the ongoing effort to understand velocity computation by the primate visual system. This Review describes the success of spatiotemporal-energy models in representing local-velocity detection. It shows why local-velocity measurements tend to differ from the velocity of the object as a whole. Certain cells in the middle temporal area are thought to solve this problem by combining local-velocity estimates to compute the overall pattern velocity. The Review discusses different models for how this might occur and experiments that test these models. Although no model is yet firmly established, evidence suggests that computing pattern velocity from local-velocity estimates involves simple operations in the spatiotemporal frequency domain.},
